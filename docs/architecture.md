# Architecture

Muxy is a macOS terminal multiplexer built with SwiftUI that uses libghostty for terminal emulation.
It is structured as a monorepo with a companion iOS app (MuxyMobile) that connects to the
desktop app over the local network.

## Monorepo Structure

## Hierarchy

```
Project → Worktree → SplitNode (splits/tab areas) → TerminalTab → Pane
```

Each project has at least one **primary** worktree pointing at `Project.path`. Git
projects may add more worktrees via `git worktree add`, each with their own split
tree, tabs, focus state, and working directory. Secondary worktrees can be either
Muxy-managed checkouts created from the sidebar or externally created Git worktrees
that are imported into the sidebar with a manual refresh. Workspace state is keyed by
`WorktreeKey(projectID, worktreeID)` in `AppState` so every per-project map is
actually per-worktree. `AppState.activeWorktreeID[projectID]` tracks which
worktree is currently visible for each project.

## Data Flow

```
User action → AppState.dispatch() → WorkspaceReducer.reduce()
                                        ↓
                              WorkspaceState (immutable update)
                              WorkspaceSideEffects (pane create/destroy)
                                        ↓
                              AppState applies effects
                              TerminalViewRegistry creates/destroys surfaces
```

## Key Integration Points

- **Editor Pipeline**: File opening routes through `AppState.openFile`. `EditorSettings.defaultEditor`
  chooses either the built-in editor or a configured terminal command. Built-in editor tabs load files into
  `TextBackingStore` and render through `CodeEditorRepresentable`; terminal editor tabs create a normal
  terminal pane with the configured Ghostty startup command. The size thresholds in
  `EditorTabState` apply only to the built-in editor path.
- **GhosttyKit**: C module wrapping `ghostty.h`. Precompiled xcframework from `muxy-app/ghostty` fork. Surfaces created/destroyed via `TerminalViewRegistry`.
- **Persistence**: All files in `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/`. Shared directory helper: `MuxyFileStorage`. Worktrees are persisted per-project at `worktrees/{projectID}.json`, including whether a secondary worktree is Muxy-managed or externally discovered. Git projects can manually refresh this list from `git worktree list --porcelain` to import existing worktrees without deleting absent entries; paths are matched after symlink resolution so a repo opened via a symlinked path still collapses onto a single primary entry. Externally discovered worktrees are never touched by Muxy's `cleanupOnDisk` paths (project removal, post-merge cleanup, manual removal) — they can only be unregistered by the user in the underlying repo. Worktree setup commands live in-repo at `{Project.path}/.muxy/worktree.json`.
- **Ghostty Config**: Managed by `MuxyConfig`, stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/ghostty.conf`. Seeded from `~/.config/ghostty/config` on first run.
- **Updates**: Sparkle framework via `UpdateService`.
- **Window Title**: `NSWindow.title` is hidden visually (`titleVisibility = .hidden`) but set
  reactively by `WindowTitleUpdater` in `MainWindow` to `{project name} — {active tab title}`
  (or just the project name if no tab title is known). This makes Muxy sessions identifiable
  to accessibility readers and activity trackers (e.g., ActivityWatch) that read `AXTitle`.
  Tab titles come from the active tab's `TerminalTab.title`, which follows OSC 0/2 updates
  via `GhosttyRuntimeEventAdapter` → `TerminalPaneState.setTitle`. Users can override the
  auto-title via `TerminalTab.customTitle` ("Rename Tab" context menu / `⌃⌘R`) and assign a
  color accent via `TerminalTab.colorID` ("Set Tab Color…" context menu). Both fields persist
  to `workspaces.json` through `TerminalTabSnapshot`. Colors resolve through
  `ProjectIconColor.palette` (shared with project icon colors).

## File Tree

The file tree is a lightweight side panel mounted at the trailing edge of the
main window, in the same slot used by the attached VCS panel. Only one of the
two panels can be visible at a time — opening one closes the other. Both are
toggled from buttons in the topbar (file tree button appears only when the VCS
display mode is `attached`, since the file tree panel reuses the attached slot).

`FileTreeState` is created per `WorktreeKey` and held by `MainWindow`. It lazily
loads directory contents through `FileTreeService.loadChildren`, which calls
`git check-ignore --stdin` for the candidate names in each directory so the
visible tree matches `.gitignore`. Non-git folders fall back to a hardcoded
prune list (same one used by `FileSearchService`).

Per-file git statuses come from `git status --porcelain=v1 -z` and are mapped
to colors (modified → diff hunk color, added/untracked → diff add color,
deleted/conflict → diff remove color). Parent directories of changed files are
highlighted with the modified color. The tree subscribes to
`.vcsRepoDidChange` and uses `GitDirectoryWatcher` so external changes refresh
the panel without user action — there is no manual refresh button. Clicking a
file routes through `AppState.openFile`, the same path used by the quick open
overlay.

The header has a filter button that toggles `showOnlyChanges`, hiding any
entry whose absolute path is not in the status set (and any directory whose
subtree has no changes). The panel also tracks the active editor file via
`AppState.activeTab(for:)?.content.editorState?.filePath`: changes to that path
auto-expand its parent directories and highlight the row using
`MuxyTheme.accentSoft`. Deleted paths that no longer exist on disk are
materialized as synthetic tree rows so removals still appear in both the full
tree and the changed-only filter.

The panel width is persisted in `UserDefaults` under `muxy.fileTreeWidth`.
Expansion state is in-memory only.

### File Operations

The tree supports direct manipulation through a right-click context menu,
keyboard shortcuts, and drag-and-drop. `FileTreeCommands` (held as view
state inside `FileTreeView`) orchestrates the flow: it mutates transient
`FileTreeState` fields (`pendingNewEntry`, `pendingRenamePath`,
`pendingDeletePaths`, `cutPaths`, `dropHighlightPath`, `selectedPaths`,
`selectionAnchorPath`) and dispatches work to `FileSystemOperations`, a
stateless service that runs create / rename / move / copy / trash off the
main thread via `GitProcessRunner.offMainThrowing`. Trash goes through
`NSWorkspace.shared.recycle` so the OS handles Undo.

Selection is multi-item: plain click selects one, `⌘`-click toggles, and
`⇧`-click extends the range using the currently visible row order.
Rename and new-entry both use `FileTreeRenameField`, an inline text field
that commits on Return / blur and cancels on Escape. Errors from any
operation surface through `ToastState.shared` and are also logged.

Cut / copy / paste is backed by `FileClipboard`, which writes file URLs to
`NSPasteboard.general` and tags cuts with a private pasteboard type
(`app.muxy.fileCut`). This lets Muxy round-trip cut state while remaining
interoperable with Finder (which only sees the file URLs). Paste into a
file selects that file's parent directory as the destination.

Drag-and-drop accepts `.fileURL` providers on every directory row and on
the empty space below the tree. Holding Option turns a move into a copy;
drops that would move a path into itself are filtered out. The dragged
row and all drop targets are driven by the same `FileTreeDropDelegate`.

When a path changes on disk (rename, move, paste) the tree calls
`AppState.handleFileMoved(from:to:)`, which walks every open editor tab
and rewrites `EditorTabState.filePath` — both exact matches and paths
under a moved directory — keeping editors pointed at the same content.
"Open in Terminal" dispatches `.createTabInDirectory`, a reducer case
that opens a new terminal tab rooted at the selected directory rather
than the project root.

## VCS Tab Layout

The VCS tab is organized top-to-bottom as:

1. **Header** — worktree trigger, branch picker, `PRPill`, settings, refresh.
2. **Commit area** — commit message field + three first-class buttons: `Commit`, `Pull` (with `↓N` badge when behind), `Push` (with `↑N` badge when ahead). Commit hotkey is `⌘↵`.
3. **Sections** — Staged / Changes / History resizable split.

Pull request management lives entirely in the header via `PRPill`, not in the commit area. `PRPill` renders one of the states from `VCSTabState.PRLaunchState`:

- `hidden` — nothing to PR (clean tree on default branch, or loading). Pill is not rendered.
- `ghMissing` — disabled pill prompting to install `gh`.
- `canCreate` — "Create PR" button that opens `CreatePRSheet`.
- `hasPR(info)` — pill opens `PRPopover` showing state, base branch, mergeability, and actions (Open on GitHub, Merge, Close, Refresh).

`canCreate` is gated by `VCSTabState.canCreatePR`: shown when `gh` is installed, no PR exists for this branch, and either the working tree has changes OR the current branch differs from the default branch.

`CreatePRSheet` drives the end-to-end flow via a `PRCreateRequest` passed to `VCSTabState.openPullRequest`:

1. **Target branch** — picked from `GitRepositoryService.listRemoteBranches` (remote-only), pre-selecting the repo's default branch.
2. **Title + description** — entered by the user; both fields start blank.
3. **Branch strategy** — radio between "use current branch" (hidden when on the default branch or when current == target) and "create new branch" (starts blank, then auto-slugs from the title until the user edits the name manually).
4. **Include** — radio between "all changes" (default) and "only staged"; hidden when there are no changes or only one kind.
5. **Draft** — checkbox that adds `--draft` to `gh pr create`.

On submit, `performPRFlow` runs: optional branch create+switch → optional stage (all if include=all, staged-only otherwise) → commit with title if anything is staged → `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create`. No rollback on partial failure — errors surface to the sheet with a clear message so the user can retry manually from wherever the flow stopped. Ahead/behind counts are populated by `GitRepositoryService.aheadBehind` during refresh and drive the push/pull badges in the commit area.

## Notification System

Notifications alert users when terminal events occur (command completion, AI agent
messages, OSC escape sequences). Each notification carries full navigation context
(projectID, worktreeID, areaID, tabID) to enable click-to-focus on the originating pane.

### Sources

- **OSC 9/777** — Desktop notification escape sequences handled via
  `GHOSTTY_ACTION_DESKTOP_NOTIFICATION` in `GhosttyRuntimeEventAdapter`.
- **Claude Code hooks** — Rich notifications from Claude Code sessions via a wrapper
  script that injects `--hooks` to route lifecycle events through the Unix socket.
- **Unix socket** — External tool integration via `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/muxy.sock`. Accepts
  pipe-delimited messages with paneID for routing.

### Data Flow

```
Terminal event → GhosttyRuntimeEventAdapter / NotificationSocketServer
     → TerminalViewRegistry.paneID(for:) (reverse lookup)
     → NotificationNavigator.resolveContext() (pane → project/worktree/area/tab)
     → NotificationStore.add() (suppressed if pane is focused and app active)
     → Toast + sound delivery
     → Persist to notifications.json (debounced)
     → UI update (badge on sidebar, notification panel)
```

### Environment Variables

Each terminal surface receives `MUXY_PANE_ID`, `MUXY_PROJECT_ID`,
`MUXY_WORKTREE_ID`, and `MUXY_SOCKET_PATH` via `ghostty_surface_config_s.env_vars`.
These are used by the Claude wrapper script and socket API to identify the
originating pane.

### Click-to-Navigate

`NotificationNavigator.navigate(to:)` dispatches three `AppState` actions in
sequence: `selectProject` → `focusArea` → `selectTab`. System notifications encode
the navigation context in `userInfo` and bring the app to front on click.

## Remote Server (MuxyServer)

The desktop app embeds a WebSocket server (`MuxyRemoteServer`) that exposes
workspace state and terminal operations to the iOS companion app over the local
network (LAN, Tailscale, etc.).

### Architecture

```
MuxyMobile (iOS)  ◄── WebSocket (JSON) ──►  MuxyRemoteServer (inside Muxy.app)
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                             MuxyRemoteServerDelegate
                                             (AppState, ProjectStore, etc.)
```

The server listens on a user-configurable port (default 4865) when enabled in
Mobile settings. The port is stored in `UserDefaults` and applied on start.
`MobileServerService` reports bind failures back to the UI: if the listener
fails to start (e.g. port in use), the enable toggle is rolled off and the
settings view displays the error. It uses Apple's Network framework
(`NWListener` + `NWConnection`) with the WebSocket protocol. All messages use
the `MuxyMessage` JSON envelope from `MuxyShared`.

### Protocol

Request-response with server-pushed events:

- **Request/Response** — Client sends `MuxyRequest` (method + params), server
  replies with `MuxyResponse` (result or error). Each request has a unique ID
  for correlation.
- **Events** — Server pushes `MuxyEvent` to all connected clients when state
  changes (workspace updates, new notifications, project list changes).

### Shared Types (MuxyShared)

Platform-agnostic DTOs used by both apps. All types are `Codable` and `Sendable`.
The `MuxyCodec` handles JSON encoding/decoding with ISO 8601 dates.

### iOS App (MuxyMobile)

`ConnectionManager` manages the WebSocket lifecycle and maintains a local mirror
of the remote state (projects, workspace layout, notifications). It also keeps a
rolling connection trace so mobile failures can surface a user-shareable
technical report from the phone's error sheet. `TerminalView` renders the
remote terminal grid locally, sends input back over the socket, and freezes the
current snapshot during long-press text selection so copy actions operate on a
stable view. Views observe this state and dispatch actions back through the
connection.

### Device Pairing

Connections are gated by a trust-on-first-use pairing handshake. Each mobile
device generates a persistent `deviceID` (UUID) and a random `token` on first
launch; both are stored in the iOS Keychain (`DeviceCredentialsStore`).

On every connect, the mobile app sends `authenticateDevice` first. The Mac
(`ApprovedDevicesStore`) compares the device's SHA-256 token hash against the
stored hash for that `deviceID`:

- **Known device with matching token** → immediately authorized.
- **Unknown device** → server returns `401 Unauthorized`. Mobile falls back to
  `pairDevice`, and `PairingRequestCoordinator` on the Mac queues the request
  and surfaces an approval sheet on `MainWindow`. Approval stores the token
  hash in `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/approved-devices.json`; denial
  returns `403`.
- **Token mismatch** → treated the same as unknown; server returns `401` so a
  stolen but outdated credential can't resume authentication.

Until the handshake succeeds the server rejects every other RPC with
`401 Unauthorized`. After success, the client is added to an
`authenticatedClients` set on `MuxyRemoteServer`; broadcasts only go to clients
in that set. The `Mobile` tab in Settings lists approved devices with a Revoke
action, which removes the device from storage and terminates any active
connection for that `deviceID` via `MuxyRemoteServer.disconnect(deviceID:)`.
