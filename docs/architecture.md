## Hierarchy

```
Project → Worktree → SplitNode (splits/tab areas) → TerminalTab → Pane
```

Each project has at least one **primary** worktree pointing at `Project.path`. Git
projects may add more worktrees via `git worktree add`, each with their own split
tree, tabs, focus state, and working directory. Workspace state is keyed by
`WorktreeKey(projectID, worktreeID)` in `AppState` so every per-project map is
actually per-worktree. `AppState.activeWorktreeID[projectID]` tracks which
worktree is currently visible for each project.

## Data Flow

```
User action → AppState.dispatch() → WorkspaceReducer.reduce()
                                        ↓
                              WorkspaceState (immutable update)
                              WorkspaceSideEffects (pane create/destroy)
                                        ↓
                              AppState applies effects
                              TerminalViewRegistry creates/destroys surfaces
```

## Key Integration Points

- **GhosttyKit**: C module wrapping `ghostty.h`. Precompiled xcframework from `muxy-app/ghostty` fork. Surfaces created/destroyed via `TerminalViewRegistry`.
- **Persistence**: All files in `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/`. Shared directory helper: `MuxyFileStorage`. Worktrees are persisted per-project at `worktrees/{projectID}.json`. Worktree setup commands live in-repo at `{Project.path}/.muxy/worktree.json`.
- **Ghostty Config**: Managed by `MuxyConfig`, stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/ghostty.conf`. Seeded from `~/.config/ghostty/config` on first run.
- **Updates**: Sparkle framework via `UpdateService`.

## VCS Tab Layout

The VCS tab is organized top-to-bottom as:

1. **Header** — worktree trigger, branch picker, `PRPill`, settings, refresh.
2. **Commit area** — commit message field + three first-class buttons: `Commit`, `Pull` (with `↓N` badge when behind), `Push` (with `↑N` badge when ahead). Commit hotkey is `⌘↵`.
3. **Sections** — Staged / Changes / History resizable split.

Pull request management lives entirely in the header via `PRPill`, not in the commit area. `PRPill` renders one of the states from `VCSTabState.PRLaunchState`:

- `hidden` — nothing to PR (clean tree on default branch, or loading). Pill is not rendered.
- `ghMissing` — disabled pill prompting to install `gh`.
- `canCreate` — "Create PR" button that opens `CreatePRSheet`.
- `hasPR(info)` — pill opens `PRPopover` showing state, base branch, mergeability, and actions (Open on GitHub, Merge, Close, Refresh).

`canCreate` is gated by `VCSTabState.canCreatePR`: shown when `gh` is installed, no PR exists for this branch, and either the working tree has changes OR the current branch differs from the default branch.

`CreatePRSheet` drives the end-to-end flow via a `PRCreateRequest` passed to `VCSTabState.openPullRequest`:

1. **Target branch** — picked from `GitRepositoryService.listRemoteBranches` (remote-only), pre-selecting the repo's default branch.
2. **Title + description** — entered by the user; both fields start blank.
3. **Branch strategy** — radio between "use current branch" (hidden when on the default branch or when current == target) and "create new branch" (starts blank, then auto-slugs from the title until the user edits the name manually).
4. **Include** — radio between "all changes" (default) and "only staged"; hidden when there are no changes or only one kind.
5. **Draft** — checkbox that adds `--draft` to `gh pr create`.

On submit, `performPRFlow` runs: optional branch create+switch → optional stage (all if include=all, staged-only otherwise) → commit with title if anything is staged → `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create`. No rollback on partial failure — errors surface to the sheet with a clear message so the user can retry manually from wherever the flow stopped. Ahead/behind counts are populated by `GitRepositoryService.aheadBehind` during refresh and drive the push/pull badges in the commit area.
